JavaScript Day 1 – Basic Notes
(Node.js Version)

1) WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?

JavaScript is a programming language.
It is used to make websites interactive.
When using Node.js, we can run JavaScript in the terminal.


2) PRINTING OUTPUT IN TERMINAL

Code:

console.log("Hello Bain, Welcome to JavaScript");

Explanation:

- console.log() is used to print output.
- Anything inside (" ") will be displayed.
- This works in Node.js terminal.

Output:
Hello Bain, Welcome to JavaScript


3) VARIABLES

A variable is like a container (box) that stores data.

Syntax:
let variableName = value;

Example:

let name = "Babin";
let age = 19;
const country = "Nepal";

Explanation:

- let → value can be changed later
- const → value cannot be changed
- name stores "Babin"
- age stores 19
- country stores "Nepal"

Example of changing let value:

age = 20;   (Allowed)

Example of changing const value:

country = "India";   (Error Not allowed)



4) PRINTING VARIABLES


Code:

console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
console.log("Country:", country);

Explanation:

- We can print text and variable together.
- The comma (,) joins text and variable value.

Output:
Name: Babin
Age: 19
Country: Nepal



5) DATA TYPES


JavaScript has different types of data.

Example:

let isStudent = true;
let value = null;
let x;

Explanation:

1. Boolean
   - true or false
   - Used for yes/no type data
   Example: isStudent = true

2. Null
   - Means empty on purpose
   - No value assigned intentionally
   Example: value = null

3. Undefined
   - When a variable is created but no value is given
   Example: let x;
   - x becomes undefined


6) PRINTING DATA TYPES

Code:

console.log("Is Student:", isStudent);
console.log("Value:", value);
console.log("X:", x);

Output:
Is Student: true
Value: null
X: undefined

let isStudent = true;
let value = null;
