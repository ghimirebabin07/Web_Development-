CSS Summary Notes

I have learned many important concepts in CSS that help me style and design web pages. 
First, I practiced text styling. I can change the color, font, size, and alignment of text. 
For example, I used darkblue for headings, Times New Roman for fonts, and centered text 
to make it look neat.

Next, I studied the box model. This includes margin, padding, borders, and shadows. 
I tried different border styles like solid, double, and rounded corners. I also used 
box-shadow to make cards look lifted and more attractive.

I learned about backgrounds. I used solid colors and also gradients like 
linear-gradient(120deg, #4e70dd, #f2f4f7). I added hover effects so that elements 
change color when the mouse moves over them.

For layout, I used Flexbox. With display: flex, justify-content: center, and gap, 
I arranged boxes, cards, and navigation bars neatly on the page. Flexbox makes 
designing layouts easier and more responsive.

I styled buttons with padding, colors, rounded corners, and hover effects. Some buttons 
had gradient backgrounds and smooth transitions. This makes them interactive and 
user-friendly.

I created cards and boxes for content. I even made profile cards with circular images 
using border-radius: 50%. I also styled forms, making inputs, textareas, and dropdowns 
look clean. I added focus effects so they highlight when clicked.

I built a navigation bar using Flexbox, styled links, and added spacing. I also used 
transitions and transforms to animate hover effects, like scaling images or moving 
cards slightly upward.

In summary, I have learned:
- Text styling (fonts, colors, alignment)
- Box model (margin, padding, borders, shadows)
- Backgrounds (colors, gradients, hover effects)
- Layout with Flexbox
- Buttons with hover and transitions
- Cards, boxes, and profile components
- Forms with inputs, labels, and focus states
- Navigation bars
- Animations with transitions and transforms

This means I now understand the core building blocks of CSS. I can style text, 
arrange layouts, design interactive elements, and make web pages visually appealing.
